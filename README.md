# OmniAuth Shopify

Shopify OAuth2 Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-shopify-oauth2'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Shopify` is simply a Rack middleware. Read [the OmniAuth 1.0 docs](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) for detailed instructions.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :shopify, ENV['SHOPIFY_API_KEY'], ENV['SHOPIFY_SHARED_SECRET']
end
```

## Configuring

You can configure the scope, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A comma-separated list of permissions you want to request from the user. See [the Shopify API docs](http://docs.shopify.com/api/tutorials/oauth) for a full list of available permissions.

* You **MUST** initiate the OmniAuth process by passing in a `shop` query parameter of the shop youâ€™re requesting permissions for example. http://localhost:3000/auth/shopify?shop=example.myshopify.com. 

For example, to request `read_products`, `read_orders` and `write_content` permissions and display the authentication page:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :shopify, ENV['SHOPIFY_API_KEY'], ENV['SHOPIFY_SHARED_SECRET'], :scope => 'read_products,read_orders,write_content'
end
```

## Authentication Hash

Here's an example *Authentication Hash* available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'shopify',
  :uid => 'example.myshopify.com',
  :credentials => {
    :token => 'afasd923kjh0934kf', # OAuth 2.0 access_token, which you store and use to authenticate API requests
  }
}
```
